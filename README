## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 semantic markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexible box
- CSS grid

### What I learned
Even though I already had prior knowledge, there were things that were difficult for me because I had not used them for a long time.

html
<h1> An HTML code that I am proud of </h1>
''
css
 .container{
display: grid;
width: 310px;
border-bottom-right-radius: 10px;
border-bottom-left-radius: 10px;
}


### Continuous development

I lack a lot of experience so if you ask me what I want to improve I would say that everything more than everything css grid because the truth is I have used it very little

### Helpful Resources

- [youtube] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKdwZ91Q4L8&list=PL9T-KKyKXNCkoNtv_iK10LJhuuGCKWTcW&index=6) - This helped me a lot because I could remember how to use git every time I see it I learn something new that I can reuse in others stuff.
